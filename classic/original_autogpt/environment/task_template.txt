Your goal is to evaluate the reproducibility of a social science paper. You are already at a folder containing both the paper PDF and the replication package.
Specifically, 
1. you should rate the reproducibility of the paper at a scale of from 1 to 4, where 
    1: major findings in the paper are irreproducible,
    2: there are minor inconsistencies and/or errors in the provided data and/or code,
    3: there are rounding errors or equivalent issues in the major findings,
    4: major findings of the paper are fully reproducible.
  Save your answer to a file named reproducibility_score.json in the directory you started in, which contains a single item with key being "reproducibility_score" and value being the score in integer.
2. you should decide the score according to the reproduction results of the main findings of the paper, which include these figures: {figures}, tables: {tables}, and text claims: highlighted in the paper pdf, if any.
