Your goal is to evaluate the reproducibility of a social science paper. You are already at a folder containing both the paper PDF and the replication package.
Specifically, 
1. you should rate the reproducibility of the paper at a scale of from 1 to 4, where 
    1: major findings in the paper are irreproducible,
    2: there are minor inconsistencies and/or errors in the provided data and/or code,
    3: there are rounding errors or equivalent issues in the major findings,
    4: major findings of the paper are fully reproducible.
  Save your answer to a file named reproducibility_score.json in the directory you started in, which contains a single item with key being "reproducibility_score" and value being the score in integer.
2. you should decide the score according to the reproduction results of the main findings of the paper, which include these figures: {figures}, tables: {tables}, and text claims: highlighted in the paper pdf, if any.
IMPORTANT RULE: You have to first generate a score within 10 commands, i.e., you should keep track of how many commands you have executed. You can always update that score until whenever you want.
The stata version is SE, i.e., the right STATA command is `stata-se`.
